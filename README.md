# FIFA 21 Data Cleaning

I took part in a data cleaning contest organized by Promise Nonso and Victor Somadina. The contest presented a chance for Data Analysts of all skill levels - beginners, intermediates, and even experts - to create an impressive project that can be shared with recruiters as part of their portfolio.

The challenge also provided an opportunity for Data Analysts to connect with other learners and expand their network.

The project involved analyzing a FIFA21 dataset scraped from the sofifa website. The data was quite disorganized and untidy. The project's objective was to tidy up the data and prepare it for future modeling.
